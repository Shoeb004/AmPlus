# Ambulance Service Using Android Application

> **Abstract** : Initially the ambulance driver did not know the exact location of the accident spot because of the heavy traffic due to this we cannot save many people's life. By current technology era everything runs on smart phones and applications so we created an mobile application by live tracking of ambulance service .This app will have ambulance driver’s register their availability and location. Either executive emergency helpline or user’s on client side will book an ambulance and the user login .The user’s location will be pin pointed on the Google map and even the ambulance which is nearby the user will be pin pointed on the map , once the patient is on board the ambulance location is pointed and it will send to the admin this location will be shared to ambulance driver and then the list of hospitals are pointed out on the map which helps the admin to choose the nearby hospital to take the patient on time .The ambulance location is tracked by the navigator geolocation method based on Rest FUL Web Services .This technique will help the ambulance location to be updated in the database . Moreover the ambulance driver can control the traffic signals by the upcoming ambulance route by changing red to green signal.
